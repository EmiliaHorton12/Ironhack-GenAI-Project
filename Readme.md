# Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Challenge

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a novel approach that combines the strengths of retrieval-based and generation-based models to provide accurate and contextually relevant responses. By leveraging a vector database to retrieve relevant documents and a large language model (LLM) to generate responses, RAG can significantly enhance the capabilities of applications in various domains such as customer support, knowledge management, and content creation.

## Piranesi by Sussanna Clarke Q&A
For my project I used the book 'Piranesi' by Sussanna Clarke to create a bot with Streamlit app that lets you explore surreal, dreamlike descriptions of imaginary spaces inspired by Giovanni Battista Piranesi’s architectural etchings.
I created Piranesi Q&A Bot as a way to deepen my understanding of generative AI and Streamlit, while building something I genuinely would have loved to use back when I was a literature student.
The goal was to explore how language models can reimagine and reinterpret space — not just visually, but conceptually — turning architecture into narrative.
It’s a personal experiment, but one I’ve approached with care and intention.

## How to run the project
